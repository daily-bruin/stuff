<p> With ease and a good deal of soul, the California Honeydrops’ third studio album remembers the group’s roots as a street band and contains the essence of the warm Californian sun. </p> <p>Based out of Oakland, Calif., the California Honeydrops are an ensemble that lacks one single musical genre; they effectively combine the brassy sound of New Orleans, a bluesy voice with an almost Southern twang and a mixed rhythmical background. </p> <p>Their latest album, “Like You Mean It,” released in 2013, was made possible by their loyal fans with over 500 donating in a Kickstarter project in December 2011. The California Honeydrops’ record boasts an established song list of 13 tracks, a happy separation from many of the EP efforts found among the stuff on the A&E; shelf. With everything from the band name itself to the drawn album artwork, “Like You Mean It” promises listeners a good time.</p> <p>Frontman Antoni Lech Wierzynski (vocals, trumpet, guitar, keys) wrote all lyrics and music for the album, except “Here Comes Love,” which was a collaboration between Wierzynski and fellow band member Yanos Lustig (saxophone, clarinet). While Wierzynski is clearly a talented musician and writer, sometimes the album calls for a bit of variation that is lacking in its one-man compilation.</p> <p>The album as a whole mixes a feel-good, upbeat sound with some slower ballads. “Here Comes Love” starts as a strong first track – it begins with whistling percussion elements that drive the song into a folksy, swinging energy that makes you want to dance.</p><p> Later on, with “Carolina Peach,” the album attempts to transition into a slower, more somber tone. However, these ballads not only lag in pace, but also affect the ensemble’s overall energy. These songs tend to drag on; the repetitiveness results in the California Honeydrops’ losing some of their plentiful charm. </p> <p>A song that stands apart on the album is “Just Another Day.” While simple and slow, Wierzynski fuels the lyrics and stripped-down sound with a kind of peaceful power.</p> <p>Another breath of fresh air comes in the form of “Prayer,” a purely instrumental interlude that gives listeners a break from the ensemble’s sometimes monotonous sound and a chance to remember to appreciate the originality presented by the group. The California Honeydrops celebrate pure musicianship and instrumental variety with a small but tight collection of sounds, from bluesy saxophone solos to brazen trumpet features. <p>Altogether, “Like You Mean It” mixes light-hearted dancing tunes and slowed-down, soulful ballads that creates a work of easy listening, after which you might just want to grab some dancing shoes and listen to the band live. The California Honeydrops were, after all, originally a street band whose spirit is tangible even through a studio recording.</p>
