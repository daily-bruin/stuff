<p> Over the past ten years, Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo of indie-rock group the Raveonettes have carved their niche in the world of reverb-heavy shoegaze bands. The duo’s sixth and newest full-length album “Observator” firmly attests to their well-established expertise in blending noisy guitars and powerful, poignant lyrics. The pair seems set in their expert ways, and while this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, the same distortions can get old to some listeners. </p>
<p>The slow-paced lullaby “Young and Cold” opens the album and sets a dark tone for the rest of the LP. In the band’s quintessential harmonies, the pair repeats “So many restless souls/I don’t wanna be young and cold” over soft guitar strums, making the track a stripped-down lament on growing old.</p><p>“Observations,” one of the album’s strongest songs, picks up the pace. Wagner’s soft, wispy vocals are layered with the band’s iconic twinging, dark guitar riffs. But these sounds are accompanied with a haunting piano melody, a new instrument in the Raveonettes’ repertoire. This experimentation shows that the band is capable of more than just noisy guitar refrains, if only for this track.</p><p>Another standout song is “Sinking With the Sun,” with its cleverly concealed serious lyrics. The noisy reverb and rock n’ roll guitar riffs create an upbeat rhythm while Foo and Wagner coo “Don’t want to leave you behind/ Wish I could have some peace of mind.”</p><p>Avid listeners of the band, however, may find themselves bored with certain tracks. The jangly pop melodies in the fast-paced “Downtown” echo those heard in “Bang!” and “Last Dance” from 2009′s “In and Out of Control.” Similarly, the eerie chimes and soft vocals on “You Hit Me (I’m Down)” bring to mind “Black Satin” on the album “Lust Lust Lust.” While bands each have their own style, some listeners may expect something more experimental and different from a group that’s been together for a decade.</p><p>Throwback melodies aside, “Observator” ends on a strong note with the aptly named “Till the End.” Fuzzy guitars riffs, heavy drums and noisy reverb are at the forefront of the track, culminating in an up-tempo rock anthem.</p><p>The Raveonettes have a tried and tested formula for their atmospheric, distorted tunes, but their method still works on “Observator,” allowing listeners to keep raving on.</p>
