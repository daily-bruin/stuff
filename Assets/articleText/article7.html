<p>“Infinite Arms,” the 2010 album by Band of Horses, is a bit of a head-scratcher. From reading about the band’s previous albums, 2007′s “Cease to Begin” and 2006′s “Everything All the Time,” it’s easy to expect “Infinite Arms” to sound like a slightly more rock-esque version of Fleet Foxes.</p>
<p>This album certainly is more rock-oriented than albums by Fleet Foxes, and there are at times some folk-esque vocal harmonies. But there is also a surprisingly prominent country soul to “Infinite Arms” that may not disappoint newcomers, but could have very well disappointed longtime fans of the band’s original sound.</p>
<p>Incorrect presumptions about the band’s musical style aside, “Infinite Arms” is a generally solid album. In it, the band does a great job of mixing melancholy, grand, wistful and upbeat songs in order to create a great tableau of songs for wanderers.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly the feel of this album: It’s a journey, a rambling trip over beautiful but stark plains. This can be manifested in the band’s lyrics literally through descriptions of nature or in a more figurative fashion, searching for an as-of-yet unrequited love.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this overriding theme of love (usually of the elusive variety) can result in some tired and familiar lyrics. For the most part, however, “Infinite Arms” is an extremely well-written album, and contains some gems which really stay with the listener.</p>
<p>“Laredo” sounds like something out of a western movie, a town that a tired hero wanders into as a stop on his long quest. The song is lonely but beautiful: “Oh, I’m at a crossroads with myself / I don’t got no one else.”</p>
<p>But the definite best song on the album is “Blue Beard.” It’s probably the most folksy song on the album, adorned predominately with acoustic guitar and a booming drum. The song features the best songwriting on the album, an example of which is: “The Midwestern sky is grey and cold / The sun never shines but that’s alright.”</p>
<p>Listeners could almost imagine themselves watching their own breath float away on a cold night, dissipating toward a field of stars. And it is that ability to transport the listener to another time and place which makes this album worth a listen – not specifically as a folk album or as a country rock album, but as an album that combines the two.</p>
