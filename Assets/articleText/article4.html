<p>There is one problem that listeners will have with “Come Alive,” an EP by alternative rock group The Gallery, and one problem only: It’s too short.</p><p>Other than that, “Come Alive” is a nearly flawless 20 minutes of alternative rock, with a hint of a Southern sound to it. Great hooks, excellent guitar work and smart song writing combine to make it a memorable listen.</p><p>The EP starts off strong with “Catalyst,” a song about a lover who came and went all too quickly and did some damage as a result: “Oh you lit me up like a cigarette / Then you burned me down, now there’s nothing left.”</p><p>There’s a wry sense of pain in lead vocalist Brendan Cooney’s voice that pervades this song and the album as a whole, and when it’s combined with extremely catchy riffs and choruses, the result is something special.</p><p>Though “Catalyst” sets the bar for the rest of the EP, “Ballroom of Broken Hearts” manages to top its predecessor. The song begins with a faint, classic rock-ish riff before amping up for the rest of the song. This song also channels pain but tempers it with the comfort of enduring pain along with someone else.</p><p>The imagery of a ballroom of broken hearts is especially poignant: “When she promenades into the dark / I let her run (because) she never gets far / Til she turns around into my arms / And we’re dancing in a ballroom of our broken hearts.”</p><p>“Who’s In the Right,” which has the feel of a rock-esque waltz, could be interpreted in a couple of ways, either as the story of the turbulent decline of a relationship or as a commentary on foreign relations. Either way, the lyrics are poignant: “We’ll drop bombs all day and night / To show who’s in the wrong and who’s in the right.”</p><p>“Last Goodbye” starts, like every other song on the album, with a great guitar hook and features heart-wrenching lyrics about infidelity: “But I caught you staring in the eyes of someone else / And now you’re leaving for the dark side of yourself.”</p><p>The album closes out with “Free,” a more upbeat tune about love’s ability to shepherd people through stormy times. It’s a wonderful final song and concludes an EP that does everything right. Even the “problem” of the EP being too short can be solved: Listeners will just have to listen twice in a row.</p>
