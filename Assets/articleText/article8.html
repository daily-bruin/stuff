<p>There’s something endearing about an album that revels in its own optimism, especially in an era of modern music in which a resounding theme is “the more heartstrings tugged, the better.”</p>
<p>“In Light,” an album by Givers released last summer, is just such a breath of happy fresh air and is well worth a listen with midterms looming on the horizon. Infectious melodies and catchy male and female vocals mix to create about an hour of pure musical fun.</p>
<p>Things start off on a high note with “Up Up Up.” Bouncy instrumentals, which include some elements of electro-pop as well as extremely catchy ““ if not particularly deep ““ lyrics, combine to form four and a half minutes of musical innocence and joy.</p>
<p>“Meantime” follows “Up Up Up” and continues the album in style with a sound that is beautifully nebulous. In fact, the track almost feels as though it is being played underwater or being obscured by a wash of bright lights.</p>
<p>Two more up-tempo highlights are “Saw You First” and “Ceiling of Plankton.” “Saw You First” features male and female vocalists singing about the beginnings of their relationship in what comes across as the sweetest argument ever: “I saw you first / It was in a dream.”</p>
<p>“Ceiling of Plankton,” in addition to having the most interesting title of any song on the album, also features the best instrumental work on “In Light.” The track features a great riff and flute feature, and shows that Givers is a gifted group when it comes to musical arrangements.</p>
<p>At times, the band’s musical prowess almost becomes an obstacle. “In Light” occasionally borders on out of control because there is simply so much going on in each song. Luckily, the group always manages to pull songs back from the brink of chaos.</p>
<p>“Go Out All Night” may be the penultimate song on the album, but it can be thought of as the epic finale to “In Light.” It starts off as a beautiful down-tempo ballad that verges on melancholy. Over the course of its seven and half minutes, however, “Go Out All Night” builds to a majestic plateau that leaves the listener wanting more.</p>
<p>Overall, “In Light” is a bit less than an hour of boundless joy and overall hipster magic. Any music fan looking for a pick-me-up would do well to give this album a look.</p>
