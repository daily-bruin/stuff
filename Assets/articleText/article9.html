<p>“Never Out of Time” by Camille Bloom and the Recovery is the subject of this installment of Stuff From the Shelf, in which we review the albums and other materials that we have received to review over the years.</p>
<p>“Never Out of Time” is a fair album that could have been a great album. The tools and raw talent are there. Bloom has a wonderful singing voice and writes excellent lyrics. On top of that, the instruments on the album are played very well. The presence of nimble cello is especially refreshing and interesting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the album is plagued by how repetitive it is. With the exception of about two songs, each track sounds almost exactly the same, down to the musical rhythms and vocal delivery. It’s not that there are a lot of bad or boring songs in the set. In fact, each song taken by itself is well-executed and enjoyable, but they grow tired over the course of 40 minutes.</p>
<p>The two songs that stand out on the album as especially good are “All of These Stains” and “Lake Chelan.” These two tracks are also the ones on which Bloom sounds the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>“All of These Stains” takes the form of an extended metaphor. Bloom compares herself to a mug that has been much used over the years: “All of these stains / Stripped away / All of these stains / Here to stay.” It is a touching look at aging and, thankfully, features a different musical style than the vast majority of the album.</p>
<p>“Lake Chelan” is also a good and vulnerable track, though it is not as impressive as “All of These Stains.”</p>
<p>The album finishes with the bonus track “Teeny Car,” in which Bloom sings about her driving with what is hopefully a tongue-in-cheek delivery but in reality is a confusing way to end a fair but relatively underwhelming album.</p>
